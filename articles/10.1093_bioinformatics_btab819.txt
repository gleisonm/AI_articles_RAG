Abstract: Dendrogram is a classical diagram for visualizing binary trees. Although efficient to represent hierarchical relations, it provides limited space for displaying information on the leaf elements, especially for large trees.
Here, we present TreeAndLeaf, an R/Bioconductor package that implements a hybrid layout strategy to represent tree diagrams with focus on the leaves. The TreeAndLeaf package combines force-directed graph and tree layout algorithms using a single visualization system, allowing projection of multiple layers of information onto a graph-tree diagram. The Supplementary Information provides two case studies that use breast cancer data from epidemiological and experimental studies.
TreeAndLeaf is written in the R language, and is available from the Bioconductor project at http://bioconductor.org/packages/TreeAndLeaf/ (versionâ‰¥1.4.2).
Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
