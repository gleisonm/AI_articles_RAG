Abstract: Eukaryotic regulons are regulatory units formed by a set of genes under the control of the same transcription factor (TF). Despite the functional plasticity, TFs are highly conserved and recognize the same DNA sequences in different organisms. One of the main factors that confer regulatory specificity is the distribution of the binding sites of the TFs along the genome, allowing the configuration of different transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) from the same regulator. A similar scenario occurs between tissues of the same organism, where a TRN can be rewired by epigenetic factors, modulating the accessibility of the TF to its binding sites. In this article we discuss concepts that can help to formulate testable hypotheses about the construction of regulons, exploring the presence and absence of the elements that form a TRN throughout the evolution of an ancestral lineage. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Transcriptional Profiles and Regulatory Gene Networks edited by Dr. Federico Manuel Giorgi and Dr. Shaun Mahony.
