Abstract: The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of Malpighia emarginata D.C (acerola) and Camellia sinensis L. (green tea) have been studied, particularly as an alternative in medicinal approach for different physio pathological conditions. Here we develop an powder blend formulated with both Malpighia emarginata D.C and Camellia sinensis L. which have in the composition higher content of ascorbic acid and epigallatocathechin-3-gallate respectively. Using different conditions for microencapsulation of biocompounds, we performed the powder production through spray-drying process. After, we evaluate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of blends formulated with Malpighia emarginata D.C and Camellia sinensis L. in an in vitro model of inflammation, using LPS-stimulated RAW-264.7 macrophage cell line. We observed that co-treatment with blends was able to modulate the redox parameters in cells during the in vitro inflammatory response. Moreover, the co-treatment with blends were able to modulate inflammatory response by altering the secretion of cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α. Taken together, our results demonstrate for the first time the synergistic effects antioxidant and anti-inflammatory of Malpighia emarginata D.C and Camellia sinensis L. These results warrant further use of the blend powder for use in the products to heath beneficial, principally in terms of prevention of chronic diseases.
