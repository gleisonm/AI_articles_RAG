Abstract: In South America, particularly in the Northeastern regions of Brazil, Turnera subulata leaf extract is used as an alternative traditional medicine approach for several types of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, chronic pain, and general inflammation. Despite its widespread use, little is known about the medicinal properties of the plants of this genus. In this study, we evaluate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory of T. subulata leaf extract in an in vitro model of inflammation, using lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW-264.7 macrophage cell line. We observed that cotreatment with T. subulata leaf extract was able to reduce the oxidative stress in cells due to inflammatory response. More importantly, we observed that the leaf extract was able to directly modulate inflammatory response by altering activity of members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. Our results demonstrate for the first time that T. subulata have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which warrant further investigation of the medicinal potential of this species.
