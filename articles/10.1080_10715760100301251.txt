Abstract: Recent intervention studies revealed that supplementation with retinoids resulted in a higher incidence of lung cancer. Recently the causal mechanism has begun to be clarified. We report here that retinol-induced oxidative stress is accompanied by cellular proliferation. Retinol (7 microM) significantly induced thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) formation, which was inhibited by trolox, superoxide dismutase, N-acetylcysteine and ethanol. This was accompanied by an increase in DNA synthesis and focus formation in cultured rat Sertoli cells. Antioxidants and ethanol inhibited retinol-induced DNA synthesis. Our findings suggest that retinol-induced oxidative stress was associated with cellular proliferation complementing our understanding of the significance of retinol supplementation in neoplastic transformation.
